NCSSM Rocketry 2020

## Software
This is the development center for NCSSM rocketry's Payload in the Supersonic B.R.R.D.S rocket.

Use [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for JavaFX development.

See [Pixelflow](https://github.com/diwi/PixelFlow) for flow simulations. **You need [Processing](https://processing.org/) to use this. Fortunately, it uses the same filetypes as Arduino.**
